* Emacs workflow
** Keybindings phylosophy
-  Recommended :: use ~hydra~ for grouped actions [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]],
-  If any alternative :: use ~key-chords~ (2 fingers in
  the same hand used as one finger) [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord][key-chord]],
-  Banned :: long term key-chords,
-  Banned :: bind commands with low use.
** A good setup
Either to write *code* or just *text*, I need:
- a good completion sytem :: [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]], [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]],
- a good linting system :: [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/][flycheck]],
- a good snippets system :: [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]],
- an enhanced UI :: [[https://github.com/muffinmad/emacs-mini-frame][mini-frame]],
- an unified layout :: indentation, color, highlight.
* Graphviz
** Resources
*** Global
- [[http://www.graphviz.org/][graphviz.org]]: Graphviz is open source graph visualization
  software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural
  information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. The
  Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple
  text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images
  and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other
  documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
- [[http://www.graphviz.org/gallery/][graphviz/gallery]]: Some examples.
*** org-mode
- [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-dot-diagrams.html][Generating simple process diagrams using dot and tables (orgmode.org)]]
- [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-dot.html][Dot Source Code Blocks in Org Mode (orgmode.org)]]
- [[https://vxlabs.com/2014/12/04/inline-graphviz-dot-evaluation-for-graphs-using-emacs-org-mode-and-org-babel/][Inline GraphViz DOT evaluation for graphs (article)]]
** Install graphviz
- See [[http://www.graphviz.org/download/][graphviz/download]] page.
- To install ~graphviz~ and the doc on ~ubuntu~, run the command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt install graphviz graphviz-doc
#+END_SRC

** graphviz-dot-mode
- ~graphviz-dot-mode~ is a major mode for the ~dot~ language.
** org-mode
- You can write ~dot~ code in ~src~ block. To do so, you juste have to
  add ~(dot . t)~ to the alist ~org-babel-load-languages~.
- When you evaluate you ~dot~ source code block (~C-c C-c~ inside the
  code block), this produce the image and return a link to that image
  in the result (~#+RESULTS:~) block.
- If you want the image to be displayed instead of just seing the
  link, you can toggle the display of inline images with the command
  ~org-toggle-inline-images~.
- Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file dot-output.png :cmdline -Kdot -Tpng
digraph {
  // graph from left to right
  rankdir=LR;
  tony -> jim
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:dot-output.png]]

** export file
- ~org-export-backends~, ~(require 'ox-man)~
*** info file
- Problem :: How can I produce an *info* file?
- Use ~makeinfo~ command.
- Translate  Texinfo  source  documentation  to various other
  formats (~makeinfo~).
- If you want to produce ~my-file.info~ from a ~my-file.texi~,
  run the command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  makeinfo my-file.texi
  #+END_SRC
- Note: Translate  Texinfo  source  documentation  to various
  other formats, by default Info files suitable for reading online
  with Emacs or standalone GNU Info.
- If you want to produce ~my-file.info~ file, you can write
  ~my-file.org~ org file and from inside emacs export it by
  running the command ~org-texinfo-export-to-info~.
*** org html themes
- Problem :: How can I quickly give a style to my ~org~ document
  when exported as an ~html~ document?
- Use the ~css/js~ themes ~theme-readtheorg~ or ~theme-bigblow~
  provide by *fniessen* at [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][org-html-theme (github)]].
- If you want to use the ~css/js~ themes ~theme-readtheorg~, add
  the following line at the top of your ~org~ document, and
  export it within ~emacs~ with the keys ~C-c C-e h h~:
  #+BEGIN_SRC org
  #+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/setup/theme-readtheorg.setup
  #+END_SRC
- If you prefer using the theme ~theme-bigblow~, in the above
  line, switch ~theme-readtheorg~ by ~theme-bigblow~.

** parsing
- ~sudo apt install pandoc~
- ~pandoc -f org -t json _org-export-small.org > _pandoc-json.json~
- ~prettier --write pandoc-json.json~
- [[https://hg.sr.ht/~zck/org-parser][org-parser]]
- org-code ??? faces and functions
- with org-parser (clojure)
  - ~lein run file.org~
  - ~./target/org-parser.js file.org~
- [seems to be a good option] [[https://github.com/jlumpe/ox-json][ox-json]], [[https://github.com/jlumpe/pyorg][pyorg]] & [[https://github.com/jlumpe/pyorg-flask][pyorg-flask]] by jlumpe (github)

- https://lihautan.com/manipulating-ast-with-javascript/
** org hyperlinks
- see: (info "(org) Link Abbreviations")
- An abbreviated link looks like this ~[[linkword:tag][description]]~
  where the tag is optional. Abbreviations are resolved according to
  the information in the variable ~org-link-abbrev-alist~ that relates
  the linkwords to replacement text. You can also define special
  abbreviations for a single Org buffer using the ~#+LINK:~ directive.
- The ~%s~ characters in the resolved linkword will be replace the
  ~tag~.
- For instance, you can define linkword like that:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
#+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s
#+LINK: emacs     file:~/work/learning/apps/emacs/%s
#+END_SRC

- And use it like this: ~[[emacs:lisp/org/org-keys.el::12]]~ or
  ~[[google:tony aldon]]~.
* js-mode
** Completion with ~tern~
- ~tern~ is a ~node~ package. ~tern~ is a stand-alone,
  editor-independent JavaScript analyzer that can be used to
  improve the JavaScript integration of existing editors. I use it
  to perfom completion in ~js-mode~.
- See [[https://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html#emacs][tern (into emacs)]].
- If you want to install ~tern~, run the command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  npm install -g tern
  #+END_SRC
- If you want to use ~tern~ within emacs in the ~js-mode~:
  - you have to install the emacs package ~tern~ (or ~company-tern~
    that have ~tern~ as a dependency). To do so, add the line
    ~(depends-on "company-tern")~ to the ~Cask~ file of the emacs
    configuration in the directory ~~/.emacs.d~,
  - you have to add the directory where the ~tern~ executable
    resides to the ~PATH~ and ~exec-path~ emacs variables. As it
    depends on the way you've installed ~node~ (either with ~apt~
    or ~nvm~), first find it with ~whereis~ command, then add
    it. To do so, run the command:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    whereis tern
    #+END_SRC
    And for instance, if you get
    ~/home/tony/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.0/bin/tern~, add the
    following lines to your emacs config file:
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setenv "PATH" (concat "/home/tony/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.0/bin:" (getenv "PATH")))
    (add-to-list 'exec-path "/home/tony/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.0/bin")
    #+END_SRC
    Note: If ~tern~ has been install globaly with ~sudo npm install
    -g tern~ and ~npm~ has been install with ~sudo apt install
    nodejs~, ~tern~ is already in your ~PATH~ (~/usr/bin/tern~). So
    you neither have to set ~"PATH"~ nor ~'exec-path~.
  - you have to enable the ~tern-mode~ in the ~js-mode-hook~. To do
    so, add the folling line to you emacs config file:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    (add-hook 'js-mode-hook (lambda () (tern-mode t)))
    #+END_SRC
  - Finally, to work, ~tern~ looks for a file named ~.tern-config~
    either in the directory where the file ~my-file.js~ resides, or
    in the chain of the parents directories, until the ~$HOME~ home
    directory. The ~.tern-config~ must contain at list the
    following content:
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
    {
      "libs": [
        "browser",
        "ecmascript"
      ],
      "plugins": {
        "node": {}
      }
    }
    #+END_SRC
** Completion with ~company~ and ~ac-html-csswatcher~
For a specific project, you get after evalute ~(find-file
ac-html-csswatcher-source-dir)~, you get:
/home/tony/.emacs.d/ac-html-csswatcher/completion/fc0158b84ee6522297baf9d3f79cc242/html-attributes-complete/
In this directory the file ~global-class~ store all css classes
defined in "css" files of your specific project, this file and the
others in the directory ~html-attributes-complete~ are produced by
~ac-html-csswatcher+~.
First line of ~global-class~ file is ~App-id Defined in
src/App.css\n~, that is, when you are in a ~html~ file of this
specific project, and ~(point)~ is after the ~A~ in a the attribute
~class~ of a any ~html~ tag, for instance: ~<h1 class="A"><h1>~,
with ~company-web-html~ and ~ac-html-csswatcher~, you get the
completion ~App-id~ (~sexp~ starting one of the line of ~global-class~
file) proposed.

to use ~ac-html-csswatcher~ in ~js-jsx-mode~ (ie: React JS):
1. modified ~company-web-html~, enable its use in other mode than
   ~derived from html and web-mode~
2. Add ~company-web-html~ backend to ~company-backends~ in
   ~js-jsx-mode~.
3. modified or advice after function
   ~ac-html-csswatcher-setup-html-stuff-async~ in order to copy file
   ~global-class~ to ~global-className~. (because in React, in
   ~html tag~   or ~react component~, to specify ~css~ classes we
   use the attribute ~className~)
** completion with ~tide~ (js and jsx)
- [[https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide][tide (github)]]
- add ~jsconfig.json~ file in the root of the project:
  see: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig
  #+BEGIN_SRC js
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "es2017",
      "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
      "noEmit": true,
      "checkJs": true,
      "jsx": "react",
      "lib": [ "dom", "es2017" ]
    }
  }
  #+END_SRC
- see example: [[https://patrickskiba.com/emacs/2019/09/07/emacs-for-react-dev.html][react dev (patrickskiba)]] and [[https://wdicc.com/emacs-as-react-native-ide/][react native ide]].
- ~company-fuzzy~ doesn't work with ~company-tide~ provide by ~tide~.

* Learn emacs/emacs-lisp
The best way to learn to code is to *read* a lot of *good
code*. Thanks to every open-source projects, we can do it. Here a
list of files, packages or people in the emacs world that I think
they are worth reading to understand ~emacs~ and ~emacs-lisp~.
** Emacs internals
1) The best way to understand *Emacs internals* is to read the
   code ([[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs][GNU Emacs source code]]). Some source files, such as
   ~xdisp.c~, have extensive comments describing the design and
   implementation.
2) The *Tips* an *GNU Emacs Internals* may also help. To go to the
   respective info nodes, eval the ~emacs-lisp~ expressions:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (info "(elisp)Tips")
   (info "(elisp)GNU Emacs Internals").
   #+END_SRC
3) The file ~emacs/etc/DEBUG~ describes how to debug Emacs bugs.

* Tips
** Commands
- ~M-x re-builder~ : build regular expression
- ~C-u C-x =~ : pop a buffer with information at point
- ~M-x list-faces-display~ : list all available faces on current emacs session
- ~c~ : in ~Info-mode~ run ~Info-copy-current-node-name~.
- ~move-past-close-and-reindent~ : Move past next ‘)’, delete
  indentation before it, then indent after it.
- ~C-u M-!~ : result of the shell command in the current directory
- ~M-x ielm~
** emacs setup
- Keep free the key chords ~C-<f1>~, ~C-<f2>~ , ~C-<f3>~ to use it
to bind ~kmacro~ if needed.
- If you want to mute warning messages, add this line ~(setq
warning-minimum-level :emergency)~ to your emacs configuration.
** miscellaneous
- The sentence commands assume that you follow the American typist’s
  convention of putting two spaces at the end of a sentence (see:
  (info "(emacs) Sentences") and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5v2iB1FqFw][Emacs: transpose text (Protesilaos Stavrou)]]).
- When you update you emacs version (for instance with ~sudo apt
  update~), you have to recompile all your installed emacs
  packages. As I'm using ~Cask~ to manage my emacs package
  dependencies, the best way to do it is:
  1. Remove the directory where are stored your packages
     "~/.emacs.d/.cask/28.0/",
  2. Then reinstall your ~Cask~ dependencies by running the command:
     ~cask install~.

- ~mark-ring~ :
- Don't try to ~push-mark~ when that you want is to cycle into the ~mark-ring~.
- Better is to ~defadvice~ before with ~(push-mark)~ other
  commands when they move point and you may want to go back to the
  position. [[https://gist.github.com/magnars/2350388][see magnars to do the advice.]]
- ~key-chord~ example: ~(key-chord-define js-mode-map ";;" "\C-e;")~
- Don't rebind ~(kbd "ESC")~ , it doesn't work and break some
internal emacs stuff. Better to bind ~[escape]~.
See: [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/14755/how-to-remove-bindings-to-the-esc-prefix-key][escape prefix key]]
- To open a file as ~sudo~, emacs use ~tramp~. To do so:
1) with ~counsel-find-file~: give the path of the file,
   - run ~counsel-find-file~,
   - in ~ivy-minibuffer~, give the path of the file,
   - in ~ivy-minibuffer~, run ~ivy-dispatching-done~,
   - in ~ivy-minibuffer~, type ~r~ key to open as root.
2) in ~dired-mode~, see the package ~dired-toggle-sudo~
   ([[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-02/msg00268.html][switching dired using sudo]]).
- If you get the error ~<dead-acute> is undefined~, try adding the
package ~iso-transl~ to your ~.emacs~. Add this ~(require
'iso-transl')~ to your ~.emacs~.
** byte compilation
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1217180/how-do-i-byte-compile-everything-in-my-emacs-d-directory][Byte compilation:]]
  see the emacs functions ~byte-compile-file~, ~byte-recompile-file~,
  ~byte-recompile-directory~. You can do: ~M-x
  byte-recompile-directory~.
  - When you upgrade your emacs (for example from 24 to 26), some
    packages wouldn't work because they have been byte compile with the
    old version. Think to byte compile your packages with the newer
    emacs version.
** emacs command line in terminal
*** --eval
- Problem :: How can I write in a file with ~emacs~ use as a command line?
- Use the options ~--eval~, ~--batch~, ~-f~ of ~emacs~ considered
  as a command line.
- See example: ~(info "(emacs) Command Example")~.
- If you want write ~"blabla"~ into the file ~some-file~,
  run the command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  emacs --batch some-file --eval '(insert "blabla")' -f save-buffer >& log
  #+END_SRC
** bugs
- In terminal (emacs without Xwindow), emacs adds some strange
characters when:(copying stuff frome the clipboard into
emacs, when switching between emacs (in terminal) and other
Xwindows, when lauching emacs.)
Problem solved by removing the binding ~M-[~. See
[[https://superuser.com/questions/729366/emacs-adding-strange-characters-at-the-beginning-of-files][stackoverflow thread]].
- Problem with lockfiles when using ~create-react-app~ to write
React js App. Seems to be a conflict with ~watchman~ that stop
the app whenever it detect a new file. But when you edit a file,
for instance ~file.js~, while it is not saved, emacs (by
default) create a temporary file ~#file.js~ that is a
symlink. And that symlink cause ~watchman~ to stop the
application.
Problem solved by setting the variable ~create-lockfiles~ to
~nil~, by evaluating the code ~(setq create-lockfiles nil)~.
See: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5738170/why-does-emacs-create-temporary-symbolic-links-for-modified-files][emacs creates temporary symbolic link]]
** emacs server/client
*** start emacs faster
- Problem :: How can I run emacs faster at startup?
- Use ~--fg-daemon~ flag of ~emacs~ and ~emacsclient~.
- Start a server in the foreground (~--fg-daemon~).
- Tells a running Emacs to visit a file (~emacsclient~).
- See examples [[http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Emacs_server][emacs server (wikemacs)]], [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1167484/how-to-gracefully-shutdown-emacs-daemon][emacs server (stackoverflow)]],
  [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon][emacs server (emacswiki)]], [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/39484/speed-up-emacs-start-up-time][emacs daemon]].
- If you want to start emacs faster, the best way is to run
  ~emacs~ as server and connect client ~emacsclient~ to this
  server. To do so, run the following commands:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  emacs --fg-daemon
  emacsclient -nc
  #+END_SRC
- Your ~.emacs~ configuration is loaded once with ~emacs
  --fg-daemon~.
- Your can start as many client ~emacsclient~ as you want. As they
  run with the server you have started before, they all share
  buffers, a command history, or other kinds of information with
  any existing Emacs process.
*** emacs daemon
- Problem :: How can I start ~emacs~ in daemon mode when you login
  to your linux session?
- Use ~systemctl~ command.
- Control the ~systemd~ system and ~service manager~.
- See examples: ~(info "(emacs) Emacs Server")~.
- If you want to ~emacs~ start in daemon mode when you login to
  your linux session, we use the ~systemd~ and add it a ~systemd
  unit file~. To do so:
  1) Locate the ~emacs.service~ files that comes with your ~emacs~
     distribution. Run ~locate emacs.service~ in your terminal to
     find the path.
  2) Then you have to copy ~emacs.service~ file to a standard
     directory such as ~~/.config/systemd/user/~. This file looks
     like this:
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     [Unit]
     Description=Emacs text editor
     Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

     [Service]
     Type=notify
     ExecStart=/usr/bin/emacs --fg-daemon
     ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval "(kill-emacs)"
     Restart=on-failure

     [Install]
     WantedBy=default.target
     #+END_SRC
  3) Finally, activate it by running the command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  systemctl --user enable emacs
  systemctl --user start emacs
  #+END_SRC
- ~systemctl~ comes with standard commands as ~enable~, ~start~,
  ~status~, ~stop~. So to interact with ~emacs systemd unit~, you
  can use the following commands:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  systemctl --user enable emacs
  systemctl --user start emacs
  systemctl --user status emacs
  systemctl --user stop emacs
  #+END_SRC
** faces
*** Check default font
- Problem :: How can I check the current default font use by emacs?
- Use ~customize-face~, ~describe-font~ or ~describe-char~ commands.
- See examples [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_list_and_set_font.html][list and set font]].
- If you want to check the current default font where you're
  cursor is, run the command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  M-x describe-font RET RET
  #+END_SRC
  this will pop-up a help buffer with the ~name~, ~full name~ and
  ~file name~ of the font use on the character under cursor.
- If you want to check the current default font where you're
  cursor is, run the command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  M-x describe-char RET
  #+END_SRC
  this will pop-up a help buffer with a lot of informations about
  the caracher under cursor, and the font name at the line in
  ~display~.
- If you want to check the current default font and maybe modify
  it in the interactive customize menu, enter the command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  M-x customize-face RET default RET
  #+END_SRC
  this will pop-up the buffer ~*Customize Face: Default*~, that
  contains the information in line ~Font Family~.

- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17862846/whats-the-difference-among-various-types-of-utf-8-in-emacs][difference among utf-8 types in emacs (stackoverflow)]]
*** commands
- ~M-x describe-variable RET buffer-file-coding-system~,
- ~C-q~ : ~quoted-insert~,
- ~find-file-literally~ : Visit file FILENAME with no conversion
  of any kind,
- ~hexl-mode~ : A mode for editing binary files in hex dump
  format,
- ~M-x set-buffer-file-coding-system RET utf-8-unix~.
*** utf-8-unix-with-signature-dos and utf-8-unix-with-signature-unix
- I change my file ~file.txt~ from ~utf-8-unix-with-signature-dos~
  to ~utf-8-unix-with-signature-unix~ by running ~M-x
  set-buffer-file-coding-system RET utf-8-unix-with-signature-unix~
  in a buffer with ~file.txt~ open.
  - This changed the end of line character ~^M^J~ (stand for carriage
    return and line feed) by ~^J~ (only line feed). Notes that ~^J~
    is not printed when you open the file literally with
    ~find-file-literally~.
