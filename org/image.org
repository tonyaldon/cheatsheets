** Revert svg
*** How to revert ~svg~ file from last saved version of the document?
- See example here [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/804068][revert svg from last saved version]].
- You have two ways to do it:
  - With the mouse ~File > Revert~,
  - With keyboard shortcut ~M-f v~,
- If you want the verb's ID for revert action, run the command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
inkscape --verb-list | grep -i revert
#+END_SRC

* Formats
** ~png~ and ~jpg~
*** What is the difference between ~png~ and ~jpg~ format?
- See examples [[http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/protocols-formats/difference-between-jpg-and-png/][differencebetween.net]] and [[https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/30941/whats-the-difference-between-jpg-png-and-gif/][howtogeek]].

* Screenshot
** screenshot
*** How can I take a screenshot of my screen with a command line?
- Use ~import~ command.
- ~import~: Saves any visible window on an X server and outputs it as
  an image file.
- If you want to take a screenshot of your window or a part of
  your window, run one of the commands:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  import my-screenshot.png  #window on click or selection with mouse
  import -window root -pause 3 my-whole-screen-after-3-seconds.png
  #+END_SRC

- If you want to install ~import~, as it's a program member of the
  *ImageMagick* suite of tools, run the command:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo apt install imagemagick
  #+END_SRC
