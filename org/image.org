** screenshot
*** screenshot with command lines
		- Problem :: How can I take a screenshot of my screen with a
      command line?
		- Use ~import~ command.
		- Saves any visible window on an X server and outputs it as an
      image file.
		- If you want to take a screenshot of your window or a part of
      you window, run one of the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			import my-screenshot.png  #window on click or selection with mouse
			import -window root -pause 3 my-whole-screen-after-3-seconds.png
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to install ~import~, as it's a program member of the
      ImageMagick suite of tools, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo apt install imagemagick
      #+END_SRC
