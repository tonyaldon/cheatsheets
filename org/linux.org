*** Stow links
		- Problem :: How can I manage symbolic links of whole directory tree?
		- Use ~stow~ command.
		- software package installation manager.
		- .
		- If you want to link all my ~dotfiles~ files in my ~$HOME~
      directory to a versioned directory ~my-dotfiles~ that contained
      all my ~dotfiles~, assuming ~my-dotfiles~ directory is a
      subdirectory of ~~/some-directory~, run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			cd ~/some-directory
			stow -t $HOME my-dotfiles
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to unlink the ~stow~ links made in the previous

		- Stream editor for filtering and transforming text (~sed~).
		- See examples here [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/112023/how-can-i-replace-a-string-in-a-files][stackoverflow: replace string]].
		- If you want to replace all occurrences of one string with another
			in all files in the current directory (Non recursive, files in
			this directory only.), run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sed -i -- 's/foo/bar/g' *
			#+END_SRC
		- If you want to replace all occurrences of one string with another
			in all files in the current directory (Recursive, regular files
			(including hidden ones) in this and all subdirectories), run the
			command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash

*** trigger test with ~watchman~
		- Problem :: How can I automatically run test when some files
      change on disk?
		- Use ~watchman-make~ command.
		- ~watchman-make~ waits for changes to files and then invokes a
      build tool (by default, ~make~) or provided script to process
      those changes.
		- See [[https://facebook.github.io/watchman/][watchman (homepage)]].
		- If you want to run ~pytest~ on a python project each time the
      subdirectories ~./src~ and ~./tests/~ change on your disk, in
      the root of your project, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			watchman-make -p 'src/**' 'tests/**' -r 'pytest'
      #+END_SRC
		- To install ~watchman-make~ which is part of the package
      ~watchman~, use the package manager ~homebrew~ and run the

      #+END_SRC
** SSH
*** Enable SSH on ubuntu
		- Problem :: How can I to enable SSH (server) on ubuntu?
		- Use ~openssh-server~ package.
		- Secure shell (SSH) server, for secure access from remote machines.
		- See examples [[linkhttps://linuxize.com/post/how-to-enable-ssh-on-ubuntu-18-04/][enable ssh on ubuntu]].
		- If you want to enable SSH server on the standard port 22, you
      have to *start* ~ssh~ service with ~systemctl~ command and
      *allow* incomming SSH connection by *opening* (allowing) the
      port 22 with the command ~ufw~ and *enabling* the connection
      with the command ~ufw~. To do so, run the commands
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo systemctl start ssh
			sudo ufw allow ssh  # or sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
			sudo ufw enable
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to install ~openssh-server~ and *start* the service
      ~ssh~, run the command:

			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			ssh bob@192.168.1.100
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to connect to your Ubuntu machine over Internet with
      ~bob~ as username and ~2a01:c50e:e911:9600:fc4d:b07d:d36f:6358~,
      run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			ssh bob@2a01:c50e:e911:9600:fc4d:b07d:d36f:6358
      #+END_SRC
*** Connected to SSH server
		- Problem :: How can I know that my shell is connected via a SSH connection?
		- Use ~printenv~ command.
		- Print all or part of environment.
		- If you want to know if you're connected via SSH, check if the
      environment variables ~SSH_CONNECTION~, ~SSH_CLIENT~ and
      ~SSH_TTY~ are defined. To do so, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			printenv | grep SSH
      #+END_SRC
*** Exit SSH session
		- Problem :: How can I exit a SSH connection?
		- Use ~exit~ command.
		- cause normal process termination
		- If you want to exit a SSH connection, you can either type ~C-d~
      or run the command:

      #+END_SRC
*** Use sshfs
		- Problem :: How can I mount remote directories over ssh?
		- Use ~sshfs~ command.
		- filesystem client based on ssh.
		- See examples [[https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-sshfs-to-mount-remote-directories-over-ssh/][sshfs]].
		- If you want to mount the home directory of a user named *tony*
      on a remote host with IP address of *192.168.1.100*, create a
      directory ~~/remote-tony~ that will serve as a mount point and
      use ~sshfs~ command. To do so, run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			mkdir ~/remote-tony
			sshfs tony@192.168.1.100:/home/tony ~/remote-tony
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to detach the mounted file system ~~/remote-tony~,
      run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo umount ~/remote-tony
      #+END_SRC
*** Passwordless SSH login
		- Problem :: How can I setup a passwordless SSH login?
		- Use ~ssh-keygen~, ~ssh-add~ and ~ssh-copy-id~ command.
		- Authentication key generation, management and conversion
      (~ssh-keygen~).
		- Use locally available keys to authorise logins on a remote
      machine (~ssh-copy-id~).
		- Adds private key identities to the authentication agent
      (~ssh-add~).
		- See examples [[https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-setup-passwordless-ssh-login/][setup passwordless ssh login]] and [[https://gist.github.com/jexchan/2351996][create different public key]].
		- If you want to connect to the user ~jim~ on the server
      ~192.168.1.100~ without prompting a password, you have to
      generate a *ssh key*, send the public part to
      ~jim@192.168.1.100~ server, append the public key on the remote
      file ~~/.ssh/authorized_keys~ and add the private key to the
      authentication agent. After that, you can directly connect to
      the server. To do so, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jim
			ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jim.pub jim@192.168.1.100
			ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jim
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to list all identities currently represented by the
      agent, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
      ssh-add -l
			#+END_SRC
		- If you want to delete the identity ~~/.ssh/id_rsa_jim~ from the
      agent, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
      ssh-add -d ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jim
			#+END_SRC
*** Error connecting to agent
		- Problem :: How can I solve the problem that give either message
      ~Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory~ or ~Could
      not open a connection to your authentication agent~ when I run
      the command ~~/.ssh/id_rsa_some_key~?
		- Use ~eval~ command.
		- Execute arguments as a shell command.
		- See example [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/48863/ssh-add-complains-could-not-open-a-connection-to-your-authentication-agent/48868][open a connection to your authentication agent]].
		- If you want to open a connection to your authentication agent
      that is already running, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			eval "$(ssh-agent)"
      #+END_SRC
*** Start authentication agent
		- Problem :: How can I start my authentication agent ~ssh-agent~?
		- Use ~ssh-agent~, ~eval~ and ~ssh-add~ commands.
		- Hold private keys used for public key authentication
      (~ssh-agent~).
		- Execute arguments as a shell command (~eval~).
		- Adds private key identities to the authentication agent
      (~ssh-add~).
		- If you want to start your authentication agent, open a
      connection to the agent and add the key ~id_rsa_some_key~ to
      the agent, run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			ssh-agent
			eval "$(ssh-agent)"
			ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_some_key
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to list the identities represented by the
      authentication agent, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			ssh-add -l
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to Kill the current agent (given by the
      SSH_AGENT_PID environment variable), run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			ssh-agent -k
      #+END_SRC
*** SSH private key automatically added to ssh-agent
		- Problem :: how to get ssh private key automatically added to the
      authentication agent?
		- Use the keywords ~AddKeysToAgent~ and ~IdentityFile~ in the
      ~~/.ssh/config~ user's configuration file.
		- Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a
      running ssh-agent(1) (~AddKeysToAgent~).
		- Specifies a file from which the user's RSA authentication
      identity is read.
		- See ~ssh_config~ ~man~ documentation.
		- If you want to get ssh private keys ~~/.ssh/id_rsa_key_1~ and
      ~~/.ssh/id_rsa_key_2~ automatically added to the authentication
      agent, you have to add these following lines to the file
      ~~/.ssh/config~:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			Host *
			    AddKeysToAgent yes
					IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_key_1
					IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_key_2
      #+END_SRC
*** Start ssh-agent on login
		- Problem :: How can I start ~ssh-agent~ on login?
		- Use ~systemd~ by adding a user sytemd unit for ~ssh-agent~.
		- See examples [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18880024/start-ssh-agent-on-login][start-ssh-agent-on-login]].
		- If you want to start ~ssh-agent~ on login, you have to add a
      ~ssh-agent.service~ user systemd unit, export ~SSH_AUTH_SOCK~
      environment in the ~.bashrc~ file, ~enable~ and ~start~ the
      ~ssh-agent~ unit, and specify (in the file ~~/.ssh/config~) that
      keys should be automatically added to a running ~ssh-agent~.
			1) file ~~/.config/systemd/user/ssh-agent.service~:
				 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
				 [Unit]
				 Description=SSH key agent
				 
				 [Service]
				 Type=forking
				 Environment=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=%t/ssh-agent.socket
				 ExecStart=/usr/bin/ssh-agent -a $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
				 
				 [Install]
				 WantedBy=default.target
			   #+END_SRC
			2) file ~.bashrc~:
				 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
			   export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-agent.socket"
				 #+END_SRC
			3) in a terminal, run the commands:
				 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
				 systemctl --user enable ssh-agent
				 systemctl --user start ssh-agent
				 #+END_SRC
			4) file ~~./ssh/config~, if you have two private keys:
				 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
				 Host *
			        AddKeysToAgent yes
							IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_key_1
							IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_key_2
				 #+END_SRC
		- Note that after login, before the first use of ~ssh~ (via
      ~ssh~, ~git~, ...), your ~ssh-agent~ doesn't know about your keys,
      so ~ssh-add -l~ lists anything.
** Servers
*** php server
		- Problem :: How to run a php server?
		- Use the command ~php~.
		- If the directory contains a ~index.php~ file, to have the server
			running on ~localhost~ on port ~8080~, run the command:

      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to check if ~nginx~ is running, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo systemctl status nginx
      #+END_SRC
		- Each time you modify your ~nginx~ configuration, you have to
      ~reload~ ~nginx~. To do so, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo systemctl reload nginx
      #+END_SRC
*** nginx default configuration
		- Problem :: What is the default configuration of ~nginx~ after
      installing it?
		- See example [[https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04/][(linuxize) install nginx]].
		- By default, ~nginx~ serves the file ~index.nginx-debian.html~ on
      ~localhost~ (~127.0.0.1~) on ~port 80~. Just after intalling
      ~nginx~, before any modification, you can visit the address
      ~http://127.0.0.1~ on your browser.
		- This happens because ~nginx~ looks at config files on the directory
      ~/etc/nginx/sites-enabled~. It sees the file
      ~/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default~ that is a symlink of the file
      ~/etc/nginx/sites-available/default~. This default file tells
      ~nginx~ to serve the file ~index.nginx-debian.html~ that is in
      the directory ~/var/www/html~. And the config file [[../linux/etc_nginx_sites-available_default.txt][default]],
      after flushing the commented lines, is as follow:
		  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
			server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
			}
      #+END_SRC
*** nginx reverse proxy
		- Problem :: How can I set nginx to be a reverse proxy?
		- Use ~proxy_pass~ directive in your ~nginx block~ configuration.
		- To pass a request to an HTTP proxied server, the ~proxy_pass~
      directive is specified inside a ~location~.
		- See examples [[https://linuxize.com/post/nginx-reverse-proxy/][(linuxize) nginx reverse proxy]], [[https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/][(nginx.com) reverse proxy]] 
		  and [[http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass][(documentation) proxy_pass]].
		- If you want to serve at ~mydomain.com~ an application that is running as a http
      server (node app, flask app,...) on ~http://127.0.0.1:5000~,
      your ~nginx block~ for ~mydomain.com~ defined in the file
      ~/etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.conf~ must contain the
      following lines:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			server {
			  listen 80;
				server_name www.mydomain.com mydomain.com;
				
				location / {
				proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
				}
			}
      #+END_SRC
*** error (nginx): cannot get
		- Problem :: How can I fix the nginx error ~error (nginx): cannot
      get /app~ related to proxy servers?
		- See ~proxy_pass~ directive in your ~block~ configuration.
		- The error was that I was trying to pass ~location~ ~/app~ to
      the address ~http://127.0.0.1:5000~ without putting a ~/~ a the
      end of the address. To solve the problem, I add a ~/~ to the
      ~proxy_pass~ address. My ~block~ configuration
      ~/etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.conf~ contains the
      following lines: 
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			location /app {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/;
			}
      #+END_SRC
** Connection
*** Wifi connection
		- Problem :: How can I restart my wifi connection?
		- Use ~service~ command.
		- run a System V init script.
		- See examples [[https://askubuntu.com/questions/271387/how-to-restart-wifi-connection][restart wifi connection]].
		- If you want to restart your wifi connection, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo service network-manager restart
      #+END_SRC
** ftp
*** ftp session down once I run a command
		- Problem :: Why do I get kicked out of a FTP session once I run a
      command?
		- Use ~ufw~ command.
		- Program for managing a netfilter firewall.
		- See examples [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90487/why-do-i-get-kicked-out-of-a-ftp-session-once-i-run-a-command/90501][ftp error due to firewall]].
		- If you want to open all the port to not have problem of
      firewall with ~ftp~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo ufw disable
      #+END_SRC
** Miscellaneous
  curl, wget, ping, ftp
* Devices
  lsblk, mount, umount
  [[https://askubuntu.com/questions/37767/how-to-access-a-usb-flash-drive-from-the-terminal][usb flash drive: commnand line]]
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  lsblk  # find what the drive is called
  sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/  # if drive called sdb1
  sudo umount /mnt/
  #+END_SRC
** USB drive
*** Wipe out data
		- Problem :: How can I securely clear (wipe out) all the data on
      my USB drive?
		- Use ~dd~ command.
		- Convert and copy a file.
		- See examples [[https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-format-usb-sd-card-linux/][how to format usb drives]].
		- If you want to wipe out all the data on your USB drive, plug
      it, be sure that is not mounted, and assuming that your target drive
      is ~/dev/sdb~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 status=progress
      #+END_SRC
		- Last time, for a 32GB usb drive, the process took about 30
      minuntes to complete.
		- Once the disk is erased, the ~dd~ command will print ~~No space
      left on device~.
*** Format USB drive with EXT4
		- Problem :: How can I format a usb drive with EXT4?
		- Use ~parted~ and ~mkfs.ext4~ commands.
		- A partition manipulation program (~parted~).
		- Create an ext4 filesystem (~mkfs.ext4~).
		- See examples [[https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-format-usb-sd-card-linux/][how to format usb drives]].
		- If you want to format an usb drive with only one ext4 partition
      that take the whole space, plug you're usb drive, be sure that
      is not mounted, create a GPT partition table, create a ext4
      partition that takes the whole space and finaly format the
      partition to ext4. To do so, assuming that your target drive
      is ~/dev/sdb~, run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo parted /dev/sdb --script -- mklabel gpt
			sudo parted /dev/sdb --script -- mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
			sudo mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sdb1
      #+END_SRC
		- When format as above, when the usb is mounted is own by ~root~,
      belong to ~root~ group and as the permission file is
      ~drwxr-xr-x~.
		- If you want to print the partition table and verify that
      everything is set up correctly, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo parted /dev/sdb --script print
      #+END_SRC
*** Name a USB drive
		- Problem :: How can I name a USB drive with an ext4 filesystem?
		- Use ~e2label~ command.
		- Change the label on an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem.
		- See examples [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RenameUSBDrive][rename usb drive]].
		- If you want to name (or rename) ~my-name~ your USB drive,
      assuming the target drive is ~/dev/sdb1~ and is unmounted, run
      the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo e2label /dev/sdb1 my-name
      #+END_SRC
		- I you want to check the name of your USB drive, assuming the
      target is ~/dev/sdb1~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo e2label /dev/sdb1
      #+END_SRC
		- The name of an usb drive doesn't identify the usb drive. For
      this purpose see ~UUID~ of the usb drive or the ~PARTUUID~.
*** UUID of an USB drive
		- Problem :: How can I know the ~UUID~ of an USB drive?
		- Use ~blkid~ command.
		- locate/print block device attributes
		- See examples [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Persistent_block_device_naming][persistent block device naming]].
		- If you want to print the ~UUID~ of the block device wich
      partition is ~/dev/sdb1~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sdb1
      #+END_SRC
		- Filesystem partitions have UUIDs but physical devices do not.
*** USB drive accross linux system
		- Problem :: How can I set up the USB drive in such way that user
      with the same UID accross linux system can access to the USB drive?
		- Use ~mkfs.ext4~ and ~chown~ commands.
		- Create an ext4 filesystem (~mkfs.ext4~).
		- Change file owner and group (~chown~).
		- See examples [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/422656/how-to-make-an-ext4-formatted-usb-drive-with-full-rw-permissions-for-any-linux-m][ext4 formatted usb drive with full rw permissions]].
		- If you want to format your usb drive to ext4 file system and
      give it the ownership of the same username (same UID) your
      share accross linux system, assuming that ~/dev/sdb1~ is the
      partition and ~my-name~ is your username, run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
			sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
			sudo chown my-name: /mnt
			sudo umount /mnt
      #+END_SRC
		- Take care, the above operations will kill your all the data on
      the usb drive.
*** Preserve mode/ownership/timestamps when using sudo
		- Problem :: How can I preserve mode/ownership/timestamps when
      ~cp~ or ~rsync~ and using ~sudo~ ?
		- Use ~cp~ or ~rsync~ command.
		- Copy files and directories (~cp~).
		- A fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool (~rsync~).
		- If you want to copy the directory ~my-dir~ to your USB drive
      mounted at ~/mnt~ and preserving mode/ownership/timestamps, run
      the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo cp -r --preserve my-dir /mnt  # with cp
			sudo rsync -rog my-dir /mnt  # with rsync
      #+END_SRC
*** Mount USB drive without sudo privilege
		- Problem :: How can I mount a usb drive without sudo privilege?
		- Use ~pmount~ command.
		- Mount arbitrary hotpluggable devices as normal user.

		- report file system disk space usage.
		-  .
		- If you want to know the available space that remains on a USB
      drive, assuming the target drive is ~/dev/sdb1~ and is mounted,
      run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			df -h /dev/sdb1
      #+END_SRC
*** read-only usb drive
		- Problem :: Why the file system of my usb drive suddenly becomes
      ~read-only~?
		- See example [[https://superuser.com/questions/1125282/what-can-i-do-if-my-usb-flash-drive-is-write-protected-or-read-only][usb drive write protected or read only]].
		- This is probably because the drive has probably experienced a
      fault condition. That is your usb drive is not safe. So you must
      backup your data and change your usb drive.
** Iphone
*** Mount Iphone on Linux Ubuntu
		- Problem :: How can I mount my Iphone on my linux machine?
		- Use ~idevicepair~ and ~ifuse~ command.
		- Manage host pairings with devices and usbmuxd (~idevicepair~).
		- Mount directories of an iOS device locally using fuse (~ifuse~).

      order to use them with ~i3~, run the command ~xprop~ and click on
      the window you want the information from and inspect the line
      starting by ~WM_CLASS(STRING):~. For example on clicking on a
      window running ~chromium-browser~ application, I get the line:
			- ~WM_CLASS(STRING) = "chromium-browser", "Chromium-browser"~
      - first  ~"chromium-browser"~ is the *instance*,

** Autokey
*** Install ~autokey~
		- Problem :: How can I install ~autokey~?
		- Use ~git~ and ~pip3~ commands.
		- A tool for installing and managing Python packages (~pin3~).
		- The stupid content tracker (~git~).
		- See the [[https://github.com/autokey/autokey/wiki/Installing][Installing (wiki)]] and [[https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html][PyGObject (getting started page)]].
		- If you want to install ~autokey~ with ~pip3~, clone the
      repository, install dependencies that are not in ~setup.py~
      files as ~wheel~, ~dbus-python~ and ~PyGObject~, and, install
      ~autokey~ from the cloned repository. We do every needed steps
      in a ~python~ virtual environment. Finally, we make a symlink of
      ~autokey-gtk~ executable in ~~/.local/bin/~ directory to be able
      to use ~autokey~ widely without enter in the ~python~ virtual
      environment. To do so, we run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			$ git clone https://github.com/autokey/autokey.git
			$ cd autokey
			$ python3 -m venv ~/.py-venv/autokey/
			$ source ~/.py-venv/autokey/bin/activate
			(autokey) $ pip3 install wheel dbus-python
			(autokey) $ sudo apt install libgirepository1.0-dev gcc \

			(autokey) $ ln -s ~/.py-venv/autokey/bin/autokey-gtk \
                  ~/.local/bin/autokey-gtk
			(autokey) $ deactivate
      #+END_SRC
		- To start ~autokey~ whith the GUI, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			autokey-gtk -c
      #+END_SRC
		- To start ~autokey~ in backgroun, run the command ~autokey-gtk~
      without any command line arguments:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash

      #+END_SRC
*** systemd service for ~autokey~
		- Problem :: How can I have ~autokey~ run in background and start
      at login to your linux session?
		- Use ~systemctl~, ~autokey-gtk~ and ~exec~ commands.
		- Control the ~systemd~ system and ~service manager~
      (~systemctl~).
		- ~exec~ execut bash commands in the ~i3wm~ config file
      ~~/.config/i3/config~.
		- If you want to ~autokey~ start in background when you login to
      your linux session, we use the ~systemd~ and add it a ~systemd
      unit file~, ~enable~ and ~start~ the service:
			1) The systemd unit file,
         ~~/.config/systemd/user/autokey.service~:
         #+BEGIN_SRC bash
				 [Unit]
				 Description=Desktop automation for Linux and X11

		- If you want to replace all the files with the same
      ~path~ on ~path/to/dest/~ by the files on ~path/to/src/~ that
      are *newer*, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			rsync -au path/to/src/ path/to/dest/
      #+END_SRC
*** rsync keep the newer file and make a copy of the old
		- Problem :: How can I keep the *newer* file between ~DEST~ and
      ~SRC~ file on the receiver and keep a *copy* on the receiver of
      the *older* of ~DEST~ file and ~SRC~ file?
		- Use ~-aub~ flags of ~rsync~.
		- Skip files that are newer on the receiver (~-u~ flag).
		- With this option, preexisting destination files are renamed as
      each file is transferred or deleted (~-b~ flag).
		- If you want to keep the *newer* files between ~path/to/dest/~
      and ~path/to/src/~ on the receiver (~path/to/dest/~) and keep a
      *copy* on the receiver (~path/to/dest/~) of the *older* files
      (by appending them a ~~~), run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			rsync -aub path/to/src/ path/to/dest/
      #+END_SRC
*** rsync synchronize (witout copy of older files)
		- Problem :: How can I synchronize ~DEST~ directory and
      ~SRC~ directory?
		- Use ~-au~ flags of ~rsync~.
		- It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to
      preserve almost everything (~-a~ flag).
		- Skip files that are newer on the receiver (~-u~ flag).
		- If you want to synchronize ~path/to/src/~ and ~path/to/dest/~,
      that is (~DEST~ and ~SRC~ become the same copy, keeping
      all files that were on ~DEST~ but not on ~SRC~ and vice-versa,
      and keeping the newer files (with the same ~path~) of the ~DEST~
      and ~SRC~ directory), run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			rsync -au path/to/src/ path/to/dest/
			rsync -au path/to/dest/ path/to/src/
      #+END_SRC
*** rsync synchronize (with copy of older files and log file)
		- Problem :: How can I synchronize ~DEST~ directory and ~SRC~
      directory, keep a copy of the older files and generate a log
      file?
		- Use ~-aub~ and ~--backup-dir~ flags of ~rsync~.
		- It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to
      preserve almost everything (~-a~ flag).
		- Skip files that are newer on the receiver (~-u~ flag).
		- With this option, preexisting destination files are renamed as
      each file is transferred or deleted (~-b~ flag).
		- In  combination  with the ~--backup~ option, this tells rsync to
      store all backups in the specified directory on the receiving
      side (~--backup-dir~).
		- If you want to synchronize ~path/to/src/~ and ~path/to/dest/~,
      and keep a copy of the older files in a *specified directory*
      ~backup~ (on both directorise ~path/to/src/~ and ~path/to/dest/~)
      and a log file ~backup.log~ (available on both directorise ~path/to/src/~
      and ~path/to/dest/~) that keep track of the synchronization
      process , run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			rsync -aub --backup-dir="backup" path/to/dest/ path/to/src/ \
			  | tee -a path/to/src/backup.log
			rsync -aub --backup-dir="backup" path/to/src/ path/to/dest/ \
			  | tee -a path/to/src/backup.log
			rsync -aub --backup-dir="backup" path/to/dest/ path/to/src/ \
			  | tee -a path/to/src/backup.log
			rsync path/to/src/backup.log path/to/dest/backup.log
      #+END_SRC
		- Note 1: In the file ~backup.log~, you can see what happen
      during the synchronization. This way you can see the files that
      have been deleted on the ~SRC~ directory but still present on
      the ~DEST~ directory that you copied back into to the ~SRC~
      directory.
		- Note 2: The directory ~backup~ contains all older files.
		- Note 3: If on the ~SRC~ and ~DEST~ you had the file ~path-to/some-file~
      that differed, after the synchronization you can see the
      difference (how the newer was changed from the older), by running
      the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
      git diff path/to/src/backup/path-to/some-file path/to/src/path-to/some-file
			#+END_SRC
		- Note 4: After the synchronization, if you are happy, you can delete
      on both side (~SRC~ and ~DEST~ directories), the file
      ~backup.log~ and the directory ~backup~. To do so, run the
      commands:
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      rm -rf path/to/src/backup path/to/src/backup.log
      rm -rf path/to/dest/backup path/to/dest/backup.log
			#+END_SRC
*** rsync delete on remote what is not on local
		- Problem :: How can I delete files on ~DEST~ that are not present
      on ~SRC~?
		- Use ~-a~, ~--delete~ flags of ~rsync~.
		- It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to
      preserve almost everything (~-a~ flag).
		- This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving
      side (ones  that  aren’t on  the  sending  side), but only for
      the directories that are being synchronized.  You must have
      asked rsync to send the whole directory (e.g. "dir" or "dir/")
      without  using a  wildcard  for the directory’s contents
      (e.g. "dir/*") since the wildcard is expanded by the shell and
      rsync thus gets a request to transfer individual files, not the
      files’ parent  directory (~--delete~ flag).
		- If you want to delete files on ~path/to/dest/~ that are not present
      on ~path/to/src/~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			rsync -a --delete path/to/src/ path/to/dest/
      #+END_SRC
*** rsync delete excluded file that you've not exclude first time
		- Problem :: How can I delete files on ~DEST~ that I've note
      ~exclude~ the first time with ~rsync~ ?
		- Use ~-a~, ~--delete-excluded~, ~--exclude~ flags of ~rsync~.
		- It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to
      preserve almost everything (~-a~ flag).
		- In  addition  to  deleting  the files on the receiving side that
      are not on the sending side, this tells rsync to also delete any
      files on the receiving side that are excluded with ~--exclude~
      (~--delete-excluded~ flag).
		- Exclude files matching a pattern (~--exclude~).
		- If you first have send the  directories ~node_modules~
      accidentally from the ~path/to/src/~ directory to the
      ~path/to/dest/~ directory, you can delete them later. To do so,
      run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			rsync -a --exclude="*node_modules*" --delete-excluded \
			  path/to/src/ path/to/dest/
      #+END_SRC
*** rsync incremental backup
		- Problem :: How can I do a incremental backup?
		- Use ~-avz~, ~--exclude~ and ~--exclude-exclude~ flags of
      ~rsync~.
		- It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to
      preserve almost everything (~-a~ flag).
		- Increases the amount of information you are given during the
      transfer (~-v~ flag).
		- Compresses the file data as it is sent to the
      destination machine (~-z~ flag).
		- Exclude files matching a pattern (~--exclude~).
		- In  addition  to  deleting  the files on the receiving side that
      are not on the sending side, this tells rsync to also delete any
      files on the receiving side that are excluded with ~--exclude~
      (~--delete-excluded~ flag).
		- If you want ~DEST~ directory to be the exact copy of ~SRC~
      directory, but you just want to send the file that have changed
      ~SRC~, delete on ~DEST~ the file you have deleted on ~SRC~, and
      do not send (exclude) on ~DEST~ the ~node_modules~ directory on
      ~SRC~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			rsync -avz --exclude="*node_modules*" --delete-exclude \
			  path/to/src/ path/to/dest/
      #+END_SRC
** Backup and archive
*** Backup
		- Problem :: What is a Backup?
		- A *backup* is a copy of data that can be used to restore the
      original in the event that your data is lost or damaged. If a
      company experiences data loss due to hardware failure, human
      error or natural disaster, a backup can be used to quickly
      restore that data.
*** Archive
		- Problem :: What is an Archive?
		- An *archive* is a collection of historical records that are kept
      for long-term retention and used for future
      reference. Typically, archives contain data that is not actively
      used.
*** Difference between backup and archive
		- Problem :: What is the difference between *backup* and *archive*?
		- Basically, a *backup* is a *copy* of a set of data, while an
      *archive* holds *original* data that has been *removed* from its
      original location.
** Back up ~/etc~ directory
*** ~/etc~ stored in a ~git~ repository
		- Problem :: How can I review or revert changes that were made to ~/etc~?
		- Use ~etckeeper~ tool.
		- Store ~/etc~ in ~git~.
		- See examples [[https://etckeeper.branchable.com/README/][etckeeper README]].
		- If you want to install and initialize ~etckeeper~ on ubuntu,
      run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo apt install etckeeper
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to ~commit~ changes made in ~/etc~ installing new
      package using ~apt~, do *nothing*, ~etckeeper~ do it for you.
		- If you want to ~commit~ changes made in ~/etc~, run the
      commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
      cd /etc
			sudo git add .  # or only a few files
			sudo git commit -m "your message"
			#+END_SRC
		- If you want to *configure* and tweak ~etckeeper~, see files and
      directories:
			- /etc/etckeeper/
			- /etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf
		- If you want to *skip* some files or directories from being
      stored into ~git~ repository, add them to ~/etc/.gitignore~.
		- If I want to *revert* changes to a previous state (commit), you
      must ~checkout~ to the previous commit and re-initialize
      ~etckeeper~, to do so run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
      sudo git checkout <previous-commit>
			sudo etckeeper init
			#+END_SRC
*** ~/etc~ backed up to ~usb~ drive
		- Problem :: How can I back up the ~/etc~ directory to ~usb~ drive?
		- Use ~rsync~ command.
		- A fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
		- If you want to ???:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			???
      #+END_SRC
		- Be aware that ~/etc~ directory contains secret informations. For
      instance, SHA-512 password are stored in the file
      ~/etc/shadow~.

*** Difference between git-lfs and git-annex
		- Problem :: What is the difference between ~git-lfs~ and ~git-annex~?
		- ~git-lfs~ differs from ~git-annex~ in that:
			1) all the large files in the repository are usually present in
         the working tree; it doesn't have a way to drop content that
         is not wanted locally while keeping other content locally
         available, as ~git-annex~ does.
			2) And so it does not need to be able to get content like
         ~git-annex~ can do either.
			3) It also differs in that it uses a central server, which is
         trusted to retain content, so it doesn't try to avoid losing
         the local copy, which could be the only copy, as ~git-annex~
         does.

** GTK (miscellaneous)
	 - If you want that ~chromium~ uses ~GTK~, allow ~GTK+~ theme in:
     Settings > Preferences > Appearence > Use ~GTK+~ theme.
	 - ~GTK~ config files:
		 - ~~/.gtkrc-2.0~ for ~gtk2~,
		 - ~~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini~ for ~gtk-3~,
		 - ~/etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini~.
	 - How to get information on the ~gtk~ settings? Run the command:
		 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
			gtk-query-settings
     #+END_SRC
	 - Find ~GTK~ themes in the directory: ~/usr/share/themes/~.
	 - To add ~emacs~ like keybinding in ~GTK~ (~gtk-3~) applications (like
     chromium), add the line ~gtk-key-theme-name = Emacs~
     in your ~GTK~ config file
     ~/home/tony/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini~. The implemented ~emacs~ keybinding
     can be found in the file
     ~/usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-3.0/gtk-keys.css~.
		 See [[../linux/Emacs--gtk-3.0--gtk-keys.css][Emacs gtk-key.css]] file.
	 - To add ~emacs~ like keybinding in ~GTK~ (~gtk-3~) applications (like
     chromium), add the line ~gtk-key-theme-name = "Emacs"~
     in your ~GTK~ config file
     ~/home/tony/.gtkrc-2.0~. The implemented ~emacs~ keybinding
     can be found in the file
     ~/usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-2.0-key/gtkrc~.
		 See [[../linux/Emacs--gtk-2.0-key--gtkrc.txt][Emacs gtkrc]] file.
	 - to switch between ~GTK~ theme you can use the command
     ~gtk-theme-switch~.
	 - To modify text size of ~GTK~ (~gtk-3~)applications like ~chromium~, add
     the line ~gtk-font-name=Sans 12~ (~12~ is the size), in your ~GTK~ config file
     ~/home/tony/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini~.

	 - ~GTK inspector~: If you want to test/debug the element (component) of an application
     that uses ~gtk~ for the UI, you can use ~GTK inspector~. To do
     so, run the command:
		 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     GTK_DEBUG=interactive <app-name>
		 #+END_SRC
		 See [[https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GTK/Inspector?action=show&redirect=Projects%2FGTK%2B%2FInspector][GTK inspector (gnome)]].

	 - If you want to switch between ~gtk theme~, you can use the
     command ~gtk-theme-switch~. To install it, run the command:
		 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     sudo apt install gtk-theme-switch
		 #+END_SRC
** Xft
*** Scale up my screen view
		- Problem :: How can I scale up my screen view?
		- Use ~~/.Xresources~ file and/or ~xrdb~ command.
		- Many desktop environments use ~xrdb~ to load ~~/.Xresources~
      files on session startup to initialize the resource database.
		- See examples [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/x_resources][Xresources (archlinux)]] and [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI][HiDPX]].
		- If you want to scale up what you see on your screen, saying that
      your ~dpi~ (dot per inch) is equal to ~96~ and you want to
      raise up to ~144 dpi~ (dpi must be a multiple of 96), you can
      add this line ~Xft.dpi: 144~ to the file ~~/.Xresources~, and
      run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
      #+END_SRC
		- If you want to check the currently loaded resources, run the
      command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			xrdb -query all
      #+END_SRC
		- To see the default settings for your installed ~X11 apps~, look in
      ~/etc/X11/app-defaults/~.

** i3 window manager
*** file content and i3status
		- Problem :: How can I add some text on the i3bar via i3status?
		- Use ~~/.i3status.conf~ file, ~i3status~ command, ~read_file~
      module of ~i3status~.
		- Generates a status line for i3bar (~i3status~).
		- i3status looks for configuration file ~~/.i3status.conf~ among other.
		- See section ~File content~ of the ~man~ page of ~i3status~.
		- If you want to add the text ~tony~ into the ~i3bar~, put ~tony~
      in the file ~path-to-tony-file~ and add this lines to the
      ~~/.i3status.conf~ file:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			order += "read_file tony"
			read_file tony {
					format = "%content"
					path = "path-to-tony-file"
					max_characters = 10
			}
