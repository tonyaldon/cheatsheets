  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  lsblk  # find what the drive is called
  sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/  # if drive called sdb1
  sudo umount /mnt/
  #+END_SRC
** USB drive
*** Wipe out data
		- Problem :: How can I securely clear (wipe out) all the data on
      my USB drive?
		- Use ~dd~ command.
		- Convert and copy a file.
		- See examples [[https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-format-usb-sd-card-linux/][how to format usb drives]].
		- If you want to wipe out all the data on your USB drive, plug
      it, be sure that is not mounted, and assuming that your target drive
      is ~/dev/sdb~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 status=progress
      #+END_SRC
		- Last time, for a 32GB usb drive, the process took about 30
      minuntes to complete.
		- Once the disk is erased, the ~dd~ command will print ~~No space
      left on device~.
*** Format USB drive with EXT4
		- Problem :: How can I format a usb drive with EXT4?
		- Use ~parted~ and ~mkfs.ext4~ commands.
		- A partition manipulation program (~parted~).
		- Create an ext4 filesystem (~mkfs.ext4~).
		- See examples [[https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-format-usb-sd-card-linux/][how to format usb drives]].
		- If you want to format an usb drive with only one ext4 partition
      that take the whole space, plug you're usb drive, be sure that
      is not mounted, create a GPT partition table, create a ext4
      partition that takes the whole space and finaly format the
      partition to ext4. To do so, assuming that your target drive
      is ~/dev/sdb~, run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo parted /dev/sdb --script -- mklabel gpt
			sudo parted /dev/sdb --script -- mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
			sudo mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sdb1
      #+END_SRC
		- When format as above, when the usb is mounted is own by ~root~,
      belong to ~root~ group and as the permission file is
      ~drwxr-xr-x~.
		- If you want to print the partition table and verify that
      everything is set up correctly, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo parted /dev/sdb --script print
      #+END_SRC
*** Name a USB drive
		- Problem :: How can I name a USB drive with an ext4 filesystem?
		- Use ~e2label~ command.
		- Change the label on an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem.
		- See examples [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RenameUSBDrive][rename usb drive]].
		- If you want to name (or rename) ~my-name~ your USB drive,
      assuming the target drive is ~/dev/sdb1~ and is unmounted, run
      the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC language
			sudo e2label /dev/sdb1 my-name
      #+END_SRC
		- I you want to check the name of your USB drive, assuming the
      target is ~/dev/sdb1~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC language
			sudo e2label /dev/sdb1
      #+END_SRC
		- The name of an usb drive doesn't identify the usb drive. For
      this purpose see ~UUID~ of the usb drive or the ~PARTUUID~.
*** UUID of an USB drive
		- Problem :: How can I know the ~UUID~ of an USB drive?
		- Use ~blkid~ command.
		- locate/print block device attributes
		- See examples [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Persistent_block_device_naming][persistent block device naming]].
		- If you want to print the ~UUID~ of the block device wich
      partition is ~/dev/sdb1~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC language
			blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sdb1
      #+END_SRC
		- Filesystem partitions have UUIDs but physical devices do not.
*** USB drive accross linux system
		- Problem :: How can I set up the USB drive in such way that user
      with the same UID accross linux system can access to the USB drive?
		- Use ~mkfs.ext4~ and ~chown~ commands.
		- Create an ext4 filesystem (~mkfs.ext4~).
		- Change file owner and group (~chown~).
		- See examples [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/422656/how-to-make-an-ext4-formatted-usb-drive-with-full-rw-permissions-for-any-linux-m][ext4 formatted usb drive with full rw permissions]].
		- If you want to format your usb drive to ext4 file system and
      give it the ownership of the same username (same UID) your
      share accross linux system, assuming that ~/dev/sdb1~ is the
      partition and ~my-name~ is your username, run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC language
			sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
			sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
			sudo chown my-name: /mnt
			sudo umount /mnt
      #+END_SRC
		- Take care, the above operations will kill your all the data on
      the usb drive.

      ~jpg~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			convert image.png image.jpg
			#+END_SRC
		- If you want to install ~convert~, as it comes with the
      [[https://imagemagick.org/][imagemagick]] package, run the command:

** Backup ~/etc~ directory
*** ~/etc~ stored in a ~git~ repository
		- Problem :: How can I review or revert changes that were made to ~/etc~?
		- Use ~etckeeper~ tool.
