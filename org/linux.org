		- Use ~ssh-agent~, ~eval~ and ~ssh-add~ commands.
		- Hold private keys used for public key authentication
      (~ssh-agent~).
		- Execute arguments as a shell command (~eval~).
		- Adds private key identities to the authentication agent
      (~ssh-add~).
		- If you want to start your authentication agent, open a
      connection to the agent and add the key ~id_rsa_some_key~ to
      the agent, run the commands:

*** SSH private key automatically added to ssh-agent
		- Problem :: how to get ssh private key automatically added to the
      authentication agent?
		- Use the keywords ~AddKeysToAgent~ and ~IdentityFile~ in the
      ~~/.ssh/config~ user's configuration file.
		- Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a
      running ssh-agent(1) (~AddKeysToAgent~).
		- Specifies a file from which the user's RSA authentication
      identity is read.

		- If you want to wipe out all the data on your USB drive, plug
      it, be sure that is not mounted, and assuming that your target drive
      is ~/dev/sdb~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 status=progress
      #+END_SRC
		- Last time, for a 32GB usb drive, the process took about 30
      minuntes to complete.
		- Once the disk is erased, the ~dd~ command will print ~~No space
      left on device~.
*** Format USB drive with EXT4
		- Problem :: How can I format a usb drive with EXT4?
		- Use ~parted~ and ~mkfs.ext4~ commands.
		- A partition manipulation program (~parted~).

		- If you want to format an usb drive with only one ext4 partition
      that take the whole space, plug you're usb drive, be sure that
      is not mounted, create a GPT partition table, create a ext4
      partition that takes the whole space and finaly format the
      partition to ext4. To do so, assuming that your target drive
      is ~/dev/sdb~, run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
			sudo parted /dev/sdb --script -- mklabel gpt
			sudo parted /dev/sdb --script -- mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
			sudo mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sdb1
      #+END_SRC
		- When format as above, when the usb is mounted is own by ~root~,
      belong to ~root~ group and as the permission file is
      ~drwxr-xr-x~.
		- If you want to print the partition table and verify that

      assuming the target drive is ~/dev/sdb1~ and is unmounted, run
      the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC language
			sudo e2label /dev/sdb1 my-name
      #+END_SRC
		- I you want to check the name of your USB drive, assuming the
      target is ~/dev/sdb1~, run the command:

      partition is ~/dev/sdb1~, run the command:
			#+BEGIN_SRC language
			blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sdb1
      #+END_SRC
		- Filesystem partitions have UUIDs but physical devices do not.
*** USB drive accross linux system
		- Problem :: How can I set up the USB drive in such way that user
      with the same UID accross linux system can access to the USB drive?
		- Use ~mkfs.ext4~ and ~chown~ commands.
		- Create an ext4 filesystem (~mkfs.ext4~).
		- Change file owner and group (~chown~).
		- See examples [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/422656/how-to-make-an-ext4-formatted-usb-drive-with-full-rw-permissions-for-any-linux-m][ext4 formatted usb drive with full rw permissions]].
		- If you want to format your usb drive to ext4 file system and
      give it the ownership of the same username (same UID) your
      share accross linux system, assuming that ~/dev/sdb1~ is the
      partition and ~my-name~ is your username, run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC language
			sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
			sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
			sudo chown my-name: /mnt
			sudo umount /mnt
      #+END_SRC

* Backup
** Backup and archive
*** Backup
		- Problem :: What is a Backup?
		- A *backup* is a copy of data that can be used to restore the
      original in the event that your data is lost or damaged. If a

      for long-term retention and used for future
      reference. Typically, archives contain data that is not actively
      used.
*** Difference between backup and archive
		- Problem :: What is the difference between *backup* and *archive*?
		- Basically, a *backup* is a *copy* of a set of data, while an
      *archive* holds *original* data that has been *removed* from its
      original location.

			#+END_SRC
		- If you want to *configure* and tweak ~etckeeper~, see files and
      directories:
			- /etc/etckeeper/
			- /etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf
		- If you want to *skip* some files or directories from being
      stored into ~git~ repository, add them to ~/etc/.gitignore~.
		- If I want to *revert* changes to a previous state (commit), you
      must ~checkout~ to the previous commit and re-initialize
      ~etckeeper~, to do so run the commands:
			#+BEGIN_SRC bash
      sudo git checkout <previous-commit>
			sudo etckeeper init
			#+END_SRC

*** Difference between git-lfs and git-annex
		- Problem :: What is the difference between ~git-lfs~ and ~git-annex~?
		- ~git-lfs~ differs from ~git-annex~ in that:
			1) all the large files in the repository are usually present in
         the working tree; it doesn't have a way to drop content that
         is not wanted locally while keeping other content locally
         available, as ~git-annex~ does.
			2) And so it does not need to be able to get content like
         ~git-annex~ can do either.
			3) It also differs in that it uses a central server, which is
         trusted to retain content, so it doesn't try to avoid losing
         the local copy, which could be the only copy, as ~git-annex~
         does.
		- See discussions [[https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/git_smudge_clean_interface_suboptiomal/][git smudge clean interface suboptiomal]] and
