*** xrandr

    - By running the command ~xrandr~, I get the following information:
      eDP-1 connected primary 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 309mm x 173mm
      DP-2 connected 1280x1024+1366+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 338mm x 270mm
    - And I can set the layout as follow:
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      xrandr --output DP-2 --left-of eDP-1
      #+END_SRC
