# About
Some valuable computing tricks.

Tricks are organize by theme and store as plain text format. To browse
and take all the power of these notes, I use 
[org mode](https://orgmode.org/) inside
[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). But if you prefer you
can export those notes you can export them either as pdf or html
document.

# Cover themes
Up until now I've started to cover part of the following themes:

1. Emacs key bindings, see: 
   [emacs key bindings](org/emacs-key-bindings.org),
2. Git, see: 
   [git](org/git.org),
3. Linux key bindings, see: 
   [linux key bindings](org/linux-key-bindings.org),


# Motivation 
* **Fact 1**: "I can't remember everything".
* **Fact 2**: "When you are working in an computer environment that use a
   lot of softwares that provide the rights stuff you need to perform
   your own given tasks, you need some reminder to do the tasks
   effectively."
* **Fact 3**: "You have to concentrate on getting things done, not how
      things are done."
* **Fact 4**: "Improve any kind of performance comes from every little
   things you do everyday."
