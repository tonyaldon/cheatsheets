# Motivation 
* **Fact 1**: "I can't remember everything".
* **Fact 2**: "When you are working in an computer environment that use a
   lot of softwares that provide the rights stuff you need to perform
   your own given tasks, you need some reminder to do the tasks
   effectively."
* **Fact 3**: "You have to concentrate on getting things done, not how
      things are done."
* **Fact 4**: "Improve any kind of performance comes from every little
   things you do everyday."
