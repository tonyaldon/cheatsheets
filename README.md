# About
Some valuable computing tricks.

Tricks are organize by theme and store as plain text. I use
[org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) inside
[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) to write and organize these
notes.

You can read these notes with any text editor thought the experience
should be better with `emacs` and `org-mode`.

If you prefer you can export these notes either as `pdf` or `html` documents.

# Covered themes
Up until now I've started to cover part of the following themes:

1. emacs, see [emacs](org/emacs.org),
2. frontend, see [frontend](org/frontend.org),
3. git, see [git](org/git.org),
4. linux, see [linux](org/linux.org),
5. mysql, see [mysql](org/mysql.org),
6. media, see [video](org/video.org),

# Motivation
* **Fact 1**: "I can't remember everything".
* **Fact 2**: "When you are working in an computer environment that use a
lot of softwares that provide the rights stuff you need to perform
your own given tasks, you need some reminder to do the tasks
effectively."
* **Fact 3**: "You have to concentrate on getting things done, not how
things are done."
* **Fact 4**: "Improve any kind of performance comes from every little
things you do everyday."
